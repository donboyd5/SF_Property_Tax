# Goals and introduction {.unnumbered}

Per your note:

> We are eager for a local newspaper to publish an authoritative piece on the coming cash crunch faced by san francisco as property prices are reassessed and tax revenues crumble.

> Do you think you could fit in maybe 4-8 hours of research this week and make a list of the key factual points you think should be included in the article? This would be prioritized over the housing project because it's time-sensitive. We would want to know basic things for a writer to pick up and then turn into an article

-   The [highlights page](highlights.qmd) provides key issues and facts.

-   Subsequent pages provide more details on selected items.

-   The Board of Supervisors Budget and Finance Committee held a relevant [hearing](budget_finance_hearing.qmd), with considerable useful information.

-   A [bibliography](bibliography.qmd) at the end gives reference information for selected documents.
