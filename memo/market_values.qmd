Also see https://sfcontroller.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Economic%20Analysis/Controller%20final%20reponse%20to%20Letter%20of%20Inquiry.pdf

The San Francisco MD lost 3,900 jobs in September, the first such loss based on the revised August and preliminary September data. The City's jobless rate was unchanged at 2.1% on a seasonally-adjusted basis.

-   In a reversal of pandemic-era trends, most of the job losses were concentrated in the tech-heavy Information and Professional and Business Services sectors.

-   While office attendance continues its slow recovery, at about 40% of pre-pandemic levels, San Francisco continues to lag most other metro areas. The city's office vacancy rate rose to 24% in the third quarter of 2022.

-   The city's housing market weakness continued through September. Since May, single-family home prices in the city have fallen by 6.2%. Across the state, housing prices have dropped by 2.5% from their peak in June.

### Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco

October 19, 2022

This report was prepared at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas based on information collected on or before October 7, 2022. This document summarizes comments received from contacts outside the Federal Reserve System and is not a commentary on the views of Federal Reserve officials.

**Summary of Economic Activity**\
Economic activity in the Twelfth District expanded modestly during the mid-August through September reporting period. Hiring activity grew at a modest pace, and wages rose further amid tight labor market conditions. Inflation remained elevated, albeit with some indication of slight moderation. Retail sales grew moderately, and activity in the consumer and business services sectors was reportedly strong. Manufacturing output grew modestly, while conditions in the agriculture and resource-related sectors worsened somewhat. Residential real estate activity eased further but demand for multifamily housing remained strong. Activity in commercial real estate was flat on balance. Lending activity decreased slightly over the reporting period. Communities across the Twelfth District were challenged by housing affordability and elevated living costs. Looking ahead, contacts expected overall economic conditions to weaken and highlighted their increasingly uncertain outlook, with several respondents citing a possible economic downturn in Europe as a significant headwind.

**Labor Markets**\
Hiring activity grew at a modest pace during the reporting period as labor markets remained tight across most sectors. Reports indicated increased employment levels despite difficulty attracting workers in manufacturing, health care, retail, professional services, and skilled trades. Real estate and construction firms as well as financial services providers reported further easing of labor supply constraints, partly due to slower activity in the housing market. Employment in leisure and hospitality remained far below target levels despite some reported increase in job applications. Airlines have adjusted their schedules in recent months to better reflect crew availability and continued to develop in-house training programs to help meet future demand. Some contacts reported continued investment in automation to address persistent labor shortages. Reports indicated some improvement in employee retention, but many employers continued to highlight persistently high turnover rates. Several contacts noted that worsening housing affordability has made it more difficult for firms to fill entry-level positions in urban areas. One contact reported a notable uptick in applications for evening shifts as people sought a second job to supplement their income. Due to an increasingly uncertain outlook, many contacts narrowed down their future hiring plans to critical positions.

Wages continued to grow, albeit at a slower pace. Reports indicated that elevated costs of living, particularly for essential expenses such as food and rent, continued to drive wage pressures upward. Employees across a range of sectors continued to demand more comprehensive benefits, flexible work arrangements, and up-front hiring incentives. However, there were several reports of hourly workers favoring higher pay over expanded benefits amid elevated price inflation.

**Prices**\
Price levels remained highly elevated despite reported moderation in the rate of increase. Reports noted persistent inflation across industries and products, including prices for food, insurance, health care, legal services, packaging, and some manufacturing products, such as plastic and cardboard, due to continued cost pressures from materials and labor. Lumber prices also rose recently but were still significantly below their pandemic highs. Energy prices, although notably down since June, ticked up in recent weeks, and several contacts said fuel surcharges were still widespread in freight and manufacturing. Nevertheless, cooling overall demand helped alleviate some price pressures, and contacts noted more stable prices for used vehicles, construction materials, and airfares. Contacts generally expected cost pressures to persist over the coming months.

**Community Conditions**\
Housing affordability, homelessness, and food insecurity continued to challenge communities across the district. Contacts emphasized the uneven impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and overall economic uncertainty on lower-income households and communities. Nonprofit organizations reported challenges meeting demand for behavioral health and substance misuse services. Contacts also reported an undersupply of basic shelter needs which have increased due to hiring difficulties and a notable drop in donations in recent months. Several contacts also raised concerns about worsened academic performance during the pandemic across all groups, particularly among lower-income students.

**Retail Trade and Services**\
Retail sales grew moderately on balance. High tourism volumes in large metropolitan areas supported strong demand for retail goods, while other parts of the District saw signs of cooling due to further declines in consumers' discretionary spending. Reports indicated that demand has picked up for home improvement goods as homeowners invested more in their homes. Tight labor supply continued, although retention rates in some retail sectors reportedly increased. Supply chain disruptions continued easing, improving delivery times and allowing some retailers to realign inventory to more optimal levels. Contacts from across the District reported low retail vacancy numbers.

Conditions in the consumer and business services sectors continued to improve. The leisure and hospitality industry saw improvements as COVID-19 travel restrictions eased further for visitors from abroad. A Las Vegas contact highlighted record growth in air travel volumes, while contacts from Southern California and Hawaii noted strong demand for hospitality services. Demand for other services, including food and legal services, picked up, and activity in the health care and wellness sectors continued to be robust.

**Manufacturing**\
Manufacturing activity grew modestly during the reporting period. Demand increased for many products, including packaging equipment, renewable energy equipment, manufactured foods, personal care products, outdoor gear, and some building materials. Meanwhile, metal production and recycling slowed down somewhat. Capacity utilization inched upward on net, while some capital spending plans were deferred due to perceived economic uncertainty. Input and transportation costs remained elevated. Supply chain disruptions and the war in Ukraine continued to hinder manufacturing, especially production of aluminum. Nonetheless, supply issues continued to ease, improving access to raw materials. A metal fabricator noted that backlogs have become more manageable, and overtime has become less necessary. One contact in the energy sector mentioned that energy use by manufacturers largely held steady over the reporting period.

**Agriculture and Resource-Related Industries**\
Conditions in the agriculture and resource-related sectors worsened somewhat. Overall demand for produce, fruits, and seafood was unchanged. However, labor shortages, transportation delays, elevated input prices, drought conditions, and wide temperature fluctuations continued to hinder production, especially for cherries, pears, and apples. Weaker global activity and an appreciating dollar reduced demand in international markets for domestic agricultural products, especially wheat, nuts, raisins, and tree logs. One producer mentioned that increased energy costs in Europe have prevented European farmers from refrigerating and storing fresh fruit, increasing their immediate supply in the region and heightening competition in export markets. Capital spending in the logging sector remained strong, but one contact in the Pacific Northwest mentioned that persistently high timberland valuations hindered production.

**Real Estate and Construction**\
Residential real estate activity softened further. Demand softened for single-family homes due to increasing mortgage rates, and elevated costs for some materials added strain for new home construction projects. Home prices remained high but fell in some areas, such as in parts of Nevada. Housing inventories were still low, especially in Alaska, but started to rise in some other areas. The search for affordable housing has kept demand for multifamily units strong and rental rates high. Despite some easing, ongoing labor and supply shortages continued to delay construction projects. One contact in Arizona specifically raised concerns about the availability of refrigeration and air conditioning equipment.

Activity in the commercial real estate market was flat on balance. Construction of industrial and warehouse facilities remained strong, especially in the Mountain West. One contact in Utah mentioned additional demand for public facilities such as airports and prisons. Conversely, demand for office space was weak throughout the District, and vacancies rose. Contacts attributed this weakness to ongoing remote work arrangements and general economic uncertainty.

**Financial Institutions**\
Lending activity decreased slightly over the reporting period. Loan demand softened, chiefly due to decreased applications for single-family mortgage origination and refinancing on account of higher interest rates. Demand for multifamily and industrial construction loans was more resilient. Economic uncertainty has reportedly led businesses to approach borrowing more cautiously, reducing originations for corporate loans. Demand for auto loans remained elevated. Credit quality remained high, although a few contacts observed some slight deterioration, and competition for loans remained brisk. Liquidity was elevated, but deposits moderated somewhat despite paying higher rates. Financiers in the private equity and venture capital space reported overall declines in investment and valuations, including in clean energy markets.

**Bay Area Losing Younger Residents**\
The pandemic and ensuing recession stripped San Francisco of a decade's worth of population gain in a little over a year. From April 2020 to July 2021, the city lost nearly 7% of its population, going from 873,965 residents to 815,201 --- the lowest number since 2010. Among those age 25 to 29 who are female, white and non-Hispanic, the population plunged by 26%. White men of the same age group saw nearly the same drop.

These population shifts make sense. People in their mid-to-late twenties in San Francisco are much less likely to own homes than older adults, making it more challenging to afford the city and easier to relocate to less expensive areas.

While the decline was glaring, there is data that points to a modest population rebound in the city. The most recent estimate from the California Department of Finance, which uses different methods than the census, put the metro's population at 842,754 at the start of 2022 --- still less than early 2020, but not as big of a drop. If the younger population returns to or tops the pre-pandemic level, our forecast for the Bay Area economy's performance could be too conservative in the long-run.

Despite continuing widespread fears an economic downturn is around the corner, the region's three major metros posted their strongest job growth since July while September's figures were revised upwards. The San Jose metropolitan region added 5,500 jobs, Oakland and the greater East Bay added 4,400, while the San Francisco metropolitan region led the pack with an additional 6,300 jobs.

### Oxford Economics June 2021

Struggling to recover from the reported exodus of residents during the pandemic, San Francisco has recouped only 28% of its lost jobs from the nadir of the outbreak. This corresponds to a net decline of 10% from the previous peak of Q1 2020 which ranks 46th of the largest 51 metros. San Francisco is expected to see job growth of 2.5% in 2021 but then jump 7.5% in 2022. It is expected to recover all of its lost jobs in Q3 2022.

What you will learn:

-   San Francisco's data processing, hosting and other information sectors collectively grew 7.5% from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021; computer manufacturing grew another 5.0%; finally, its scientific R&D sector (life sciences) grew 9.0% over the last year with 5,100 added jobs. Still, San Francisco's office aggregate shed 3.0% over the last year as the metro's finance and real estate sectors fell 2.3% and 4.5%, respectively. 

-   GDP in San Francisco remains 0.1% below the peak Q4 2019. This ranks 19th of the top 51 metros. However, with its large tech-related base, GDP is expected to grow 9.2% in 2021 and 5.9% in 2022.

-   San Francisco suffered net out-migration of 24,300 from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. This represented 0.5% of the population. Total population declined 19,600, or -0.4% over the year which compares to an average annual increase of 0.6% from 2014 to 2019.

[**Housing Outlook**](https://www.bankofthewest.com/Wealth-Management/insights/articles/economic-report/california-economic-outlook-report-sept-2022) **Bank of the West** September 12, 2022\
Bay Area existing home sales dropped from a year ago for the eleventh month in a row in July and the decline accelerated sharply to 37.2% -- the biggest drop since May 2020. The weakness can no longer be attributed to base effects, rather surging mortgage rates, low affordability and weaker demand are pushing home sales lower. Home sales fell year-on-year at double-digit rates in all nine Bay Area counties in July with the largest decreases in Santa Clara (-46.1%), Contra Costa (-36.0%) and Solano (-35.8%) Counties. Home sales fell the least in Napa (-32.7%), Marin (-31.6%) and San Francisco (-26.0%).

From [this](https://www.ioenergyinc.com/san-francisco-commerical-real-estate-market/):

-   There's been a 385% increase in available sublease space in San Francisco since Covid-19 swept in. **Translation:** Really nice spaces are available, and they're going for a song.

-   In San Francisco, non-renewal of leases is up 65%, with 'negative net absorption' (renewals for smaller footprints) making up much of the active leasing activity.

-   Article co-author, Kevin Brennan's crystal ball says that most companies will eventually return to in-office work, stating "employees are suffering from fatigue, depression and work/life imbalance, or do not have appropriate remote working infrastructure, and most employers want their teams back into the office where collaboration, teamwork and creativity can flourish."
