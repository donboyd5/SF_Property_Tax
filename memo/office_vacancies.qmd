# Office vacancies and property tax revenue loss

Commercial office buildings account for about 18% of the San Francisco property tax. Furthermore, they drive a lot of additional economic activity that also generates tax revenue. Egan estimates that they generate about 72% of the city's gross domestic product.

Graph below shows office vacancy projections by real estate adviser JLL under 4 scenarios (optimistic, base, conservative, pessimistic), from Chief Economist Ted Egan's presentation. These JLL scenarios underpin the Controller's modelling of risks to the San Francisco property tax.

Under the best case scenario (dashed black line), vacancies would fall to their worst level of the dot-com bust by end of 2026. Under pessimistic scenario they would remain above 25%.
